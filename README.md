# Smart_Room

Introduction
   
   With Generative AI widely accessible, integrating it into daily life has become essential. We want to bring this intelligence into living spaces, thus developing Smart Rooms that utilize Machine Learning to control instead of users and to respond to users' needs, offering convenience, safety, and enjoyable usage experience, and all managed by the Home Assistant OS.
The study focuses on three key features: 
1. Adjusting the light bulb to compensate light from sunlight with accuracy of 80%.
2. Counting the number of people in the room through a computer vision system with accuracy of 80%.
3. Unlocking the door using a face recognition system with accuracy of 70%.

And the results it is shown that all features is operate properly within the criteria.
